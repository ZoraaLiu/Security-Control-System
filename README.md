# introduction of this system-access control system

## What is our insipration

The idea of the access control system came from the daily life because it is used widely in buildings and households to ensure the security.

Also, it would be a comprehensive project since it combines perfectly with both the software and hardware, and it is possible to use the components much as LCD, LED and Servo, which we already accumulate some experience on.

## What does this project do
Itâ€™s an access control system, which you can open the door by entering the correct password. And the door will automatically closed within certain amount of time. The process of counting down is displayed in the countdown timer.
